# ESP32-CAM-Remote-Webserver-Car-Robot-Web-Server
Build a Wi-Fi remote controlled car robot with the ESP32-CAM. we’ll be able to control the robot using a web server that displays a video streaming of what the robot “sees”. We can control your robot remotely even if it’s out of our sight. The ESP32-CAM will be programmed using Arduino IDE.
